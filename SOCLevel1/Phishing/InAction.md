1. This is an unusual email recipient address. This is not the email address associated with the Yahoo account. 
2. This mismatch should immediately stand out. The sender's details (service@paypal.com) don't match the sender's email address (gibberish@sultanbogor.com). 
3. The subject line hints that you made a purchase or a transaction of some sort. If you don't recall this account, then it will grab your attention. This social engineering tactic is to prompt you to interact with the email with haste.

4. There aren't any attachments associated with this email. The only interactive element in this email is the Cancel the order button/link.

1. The email is tailored to appear that it's sent from a mail distribution center of some sort. 
2. The subject line adds to the pretense with a 'tracking number.' 
3. The link in the email body matches the subject line.

Question:
- What is the root domain for each URL? Defang the URL ```devret[.]xyz```

3. There is more of this sense of urgency in the email body.
