# Task 3: File Analysis
Oledump.py is a Python tool that analyzes OLE2 files, commonly called Structured Storage or Compound File Binary Format.
This tool is handy for extracting and examining the contents of OLE2 files, making it a valuable resource for forensic analysis and malware detection.

Question:
- What Python tool analyzes OLE2 files, commonly called Structured Storage or Compound File Binary Format? ```oledump.py```
- What tool parameter we used in this task allows you to select a particular data stream of the file we are using it with? ```-s```
- During our analysis, we were able to decode a PowerShell script. What command is commonly used for downloading files from the internet? ```Invoke-WebRequest```
- What file was being downloaded using the PowerShell script? ```Doc-3737122pdf.exe```
- During our analysis of the PowerShell script, we noted that a file would be downloaded. Where will the file being downloaded be stored? ```$TempFile```
- Using the tool, scan another file named possible_malicious.docx located in the ```/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/agenttesla/``` directory. How many data streams were presented for this file? ```16```
- Using the tool, scan another file named possible_malicious.docx located in the /home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/agenttesla/ directory. At what data stream number does the tool indicate a macro present? ```8```

# Task 4: Fake Network to Aid Analysis

Question
- Download and scan the file named flag.txt from the terminal using the command sudo wget https://10.49.174.192/flag.txt --no-check-certificate. What is the flag? ```Tryhackme{remnux_edition}```
- After stopping the inetsim, read the generated report. Based on the report, what URL Method was used to get the file flag.txt? ```GET```


# Task 5:

Volatility commands are executed to identify and extract specific artefacts from memory images, and the resulting output can be saved to text files for further examination. Similarly, we can run a script involving the tool's different parameters to preprocess the acquired evidence faster

Question
- What plugin lists processes in a tree based on their parent process ID? ```PsTree```
- What plugin is used to list all currently active processes in the machine? ```PsList```
- What Linux utility tool can extract the ASCII, 16-bit little-endian, and 16-bit big-endian strings? ```strings```
- By running vol3 with the Malfind parameter, what is the first (1st) process identified suspected of having an injected code? ```csrss.exe```
- Continuing from the previous question (Question 4), what is the second (2nd) process identified suspected of having an injected code? ```winlogon.exe```
- By running vol3 with the DllList parameter, what is the file path or directory of the binary @WanaDecryptor@.exe? ```C:\Intel\ivecuqmanpnirkt615```
